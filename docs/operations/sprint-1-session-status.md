## 📌 CANARY IDENTITY CORRECTION + RELEASE STATE (2026-07-23, owner-verified live · **reconciled against merged `main` 2026-07-23**)

**Recorded at owner request. No dispatch, no idempotency change, no flag change, no UPD-B registration.**

> **Authority.** This section is the canonical Operion release state. Where any other
> statement in this file, in `OPERION_CURRENT_STATE.md`, or in any `docs/operations/**`
> document disagrees with it, **this section wins** — the earlier statements were written
> before the merges below and before the Production flag audit.

### Canary identity — corrected
- The approved Preview canary candidate is **UPD-1007** (commit **`106846c0`** / `106846c060ca5e368e03f4486b45b5dd3c90ee77`).
- It is **NOT "UPD-A".** "UPD-A" was the proposed Book Now split of UPD-1004 — declared **dead/invalid** (19 closure + 7 drift failures), never registered. Do not conflate them.
- **UPD-1007 already completed Preview validation successfully** — job `AUTO-4273c3ce`: tests/build/lint all passed, 1 file, Preview `dpl_CwBMYUAWgXsDv78vn9BWuDas3WY4`, PR #3.
- **Production promotion was intentionally NOT requested** — job cancelled at owner review: *"Preview canary verified successfully; Production promotion intentionally not requested."* It is **not pending**, not deferred, and not a missing step.
- **Independently re-verified in the target repo (2026-07-23, read-only):** workflow run **`29697932299`** — *"Operion UPD-1007 → operion/upd-1007"* — `completed` / **`success`**, 2026-07-19T18:00:25Z · Supercharged **PR #3** *"Operion: UPD-1007"*, head `operion/upd-1007`, exactly **1 file** (`operion-canary.json`), opened 17:52:59Z, **closed 18:08:13Z, never merged** — which is precisely what "Preview verified, promotion not requested" looks like from the target side.

### Release state (live, owner session, `environment: production`, 2026-07-23)
- **Flags all ON:** `OPERION_AUTOMATION_ENABLED`, `OPERION_PREVIEW_AUTOMATION_ENABLED`, `OPERION_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ENABLED`, `OPERION_PRODUCTION_PROMOTION_ENABLED`, `OPERION_APPROVAL_GATE_ENABLED`. OFF: `OPERION_AI_ADAPTATION_ENABLED`, `OPERION_AUTOMATIC_ROLLBACK_ENABLED`. `safeToEnablePreview/Production: true`. (Source: `/api/admin/release/activation-readiness`.)
- **Supercharged:** fully preview- AND production-ready — business config ready, repo allowlisted, GitHub installation mapped, workflow + preview target configured, rollback target + executor present.
- **UPD-1004 (`AUTO-1005`):** terminal `failed`, attemptCount 4, `apply_failed`, commit `e42af39`. Terminal ⇒ NOT in `AUTOMATION_ACTIVE` ⇒ does **not** block a new job. Do **not** retry. Cancelling it is optional hygiene, not required.
- **`main`:** J KISS `2dc6f6e` (PR #60 merged) · Supercharged `dcb5e1a` (PR #15 merged). Failure-reason chain live end-to-end.
- **Open PRs:** J KISS #43, #38 · Supercharged #13.

### Merged-state reconciliation (repo-verified read-only, 2026-07-23)

| PR | Repo | State | Merge commit | Merged at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#58** docs/p0-rollback-clarification | J KISS | ✅ **MERGED** | `4d936fb` | 2026-07-22T23:17:13Z |
| **#59** Operion rehearsal harness | J KISS | ✅ **MERGED** | `826e1d7` | 2026-07-23T05:46:23Z |
| **#60** failure-reason visibility | J KISS | ✅ **MERGED** | `2dc6f6e` | 2026-07-23T06:04:28Z |
| **#15** failure-reason visibility (target mirror) | Supercharged | ✅ **MERGED** | `dcb5e1a` | 2026-07-23T06:13:47Z |

**None of #58, #59, #60 or Supercharged #15 is held. All four are merged.** Any statement in
this file or elsewhere describing them as *held*, *awaiting sequencing*, or *not merged* is
**obsolete** and superseded here.

**Failure-reason chain — verified live end-to-end on `origin/main` (`2dc6f6e`), file by file:**

| Link | File on `main` | Verified marker |
|---|---|---|
| 1. runner captures | `scripts/operion-apply.mjs` | `ERRFILE = process.env.OPERION_APPLY_ERROR \|\| 'apply-error.txt'` |
| 2. workflow forwards | `.github/workflows/operion-update.yml` | `errorSummary:(if $es == "" then null else $es end)` |
| 3. callback persists | `app/api/automation/callback/route.ts` | `job.failureSummary` (pre-existing) |
| 4. API exposes (owner-only, failed states) | `app/api/admin/release/businesses/[id]/update/route.ts` | `const failureReason = FAILED.has(job.status) ? (job.failureSummary ?? null) : null` |
| 5. UI renders | `app/admin/operations/release/page.tsx` | `{failureReason && …}` in "Technical details" |

The target-side mirror (runner + workflow) is live on Supercharged `dcb5e1a`; the control-plane
half (API + UI) is correctly J KISS-only.

### Nothing is pending (verified on the target, read-only, 2026-07-23)

- **No canary workflow run is in progress** — Supercharged has **0** non-completed workflow runs.
- **No canary validation is awaiting a result.** The newest `operion-update.yml` run is
  `29962327283` (UPD-1004, 2026-07-22T22:17:17Z, `completed`/`failure`); nothing has run since.
- **No open Operion PR on the target** — the only `operion/*` branch left is the pre-existing
  `operion/upd-1006`. UPD-1007's PR #3 is closed.
- **`UPD-B` remains unregistered, by decision.** **Idempotency was not cleared.** No update was
  registered, no workflow dispatched, no flag or environment value changed by this correction.

### Authoritative Operion Production flag state

The authoritative statement is the **audited runtime state** recorded above and in
`OPERION_CURRENT_STATE.md` §9 (*"Resolved flag state (audited 2026-07-22)"*): the automation
switches are **ON** in J KISS Production, and what constrains them is **owner approval gating on
the actions**, not the flags being off. The **P0 rehearsal wording** — which described the flags
as OFF and treated flag enablement as an unmet canary blocker (**CB-3**) — is **obsolete and must
not be quoted as current state**. `docs/operations/15-feature-flags.md` remains an inventory of
**code defaults** (all `OPERION_*` default `false`); defaults are not the resolved Production
values.

### Superseded by this section (do not act on these statements)

1. Any claim that **PR #59, PR #60, or Supercharged PR #15 is held** — all merged, see above.
2. Any claim that **all Operion Production flags are OFF** — contradicted by the 2026-07-22 audit.
3. Any instruction implying **another "first canary" must be dispatched** — the Preview canary
   already ran and passed as **UPD-1007 @ `106846c0`**. §"Transfer plan REVISED", the
   `preview-transfer-readiness-decision.md` canary-blocker list, and the ⚠️ "flags OFF"
   contradiction note below are historical.
4. Any **`UPD-A`** reference used as the canary identity — `UPD-A` is a dead, never-registered
   proposal, **not a second update**. Where `UPD-A′` was used as a label for `106846c0`, the
   correct identity is **UPD-1007**.
5. **`UPD-1004` remains terminal/rejected and must not be retried** — this is unchanged, not
   superseded, and is restated here so it is not lost in the corrections above.

### ⛔ Unresolved — deliberately NOT invented (record-keeping items, **not blockers**)

**1. Admin manual screenshot placeholders.** `docs/Admin-User-Manual.md` *(lives on branch
`docs/operion-handoff-2026-07-22`; not on `main`)* still contains **15 `[SCREENSHOT: …]` text
placeholders**, while `docs/admin-manual-assets/screenshots/` holds **16 `.jpg` assets**. The
filenames *suggest* a mapping (`01-sign-in.jpg` ↔ `[SCREENSHOT: Sign in]`), but no
placeholder→asset pairing has been visually verified, and the counts do not match. **No
placeholder was replaced and no filename was guessed.** Marked **unresolved**; resolving it
requires opening each asset and confirming the page it depicts. Out of scope for this
state-only correction.

**2. No verified Supercharged `DeploymentRecord` for UPD-1007.** The Preview validation itself
passed (run `29697932299` = `success`), but the ledger entry that would make `required_updates`
satisfiable for a dependent update **was never written**. This is a **record-keeping gap, not a
validation gap**, and it does **not** re-open the canary: nothing is pending and no dispatch is
required. Closing it is a separate, later decision.

**3. Runtime flag-state provenance is not a repository artifact.** The authoritative Operion
Production flag state was read from `/api/admin/release/activation-readiness` in an
**owner-authenticated session**. It cannot be re-verified from the repo — `vercel env pull`
redacts `OPERION_*`, and the endpoint returns `401` to anyone without an owner session. The state
is recorded here as authoritative per owner instruction, **with its provenance labelled**;
preserving a durable, checked-in evidence artifact remains **open**. Not a blocker.

> **Companion documents referenced above that are not on `main`:**
> `completion-photo-lifecycle-hardening.md`, `preview-transfer-validation-runbook.md`,
> `pr56-transfer-evidence-preview-validation.md`, `docs/Admin-User-Manual.md`. They live on
> `docs/operion-handoff-2026-07-22` (or, for the S2 document, in that session's working tree) and
> were deliberately **not** pulled into this state-only publication.

### ⚠️ Idempotency fact (verified in code, do NOT act on it)
`bindIdempotency` is written once and **never cleared** on cancel/fail. Key `auto:supercharged:UPD-1007:106846c0…` is still bound to the cancelled `AUTO-4273c3ce`. A fresh prepare of UPD-1007@106846c0 returns `{ ok:true, reason:'idempotent_existing' }` with the **old cancelled job** — it will NOT create a new run unless the binding is cleared. **Binding NOT cleared. This is a decision for the owner.**

### NEXT REQUIRED ACTION (owner decision — nothing is dispatched until then)

**No canary is outstanding.** The Preview canary requirement is already satisfied by UPD-1007;
option 2 below is an *optional re-run*, not a required first canary.

Choose one, explicitly:
1. **Accept the existing verified Preview** (`AUTO-4273c3ce`, PR #3, `dpl_CwBMYUAWgXsDv78vn9BWuDas3WY4`) as the canary evidence — no new dispatch needed; proceed to whatever comes after "canary verified." *(State-consistent default: this is what the repo evidence already shows.)*
2. **Re-run the canary** of UPD-1007@`106846c0` — optional; requires clearing the idempotency binding first (owner-authorized), then dispatch.

Do not register UPD-A or UPD-B. Do not retry UPD-1004. Production promotion remains a separate, later, owner-approved step.

## 🧩 SPRINT 2 COMPLETION TRACKS — Supercharged "Partly installed" items (2026-07-23)

Audit/planning basis: J KISS `main` `0f174c4` vs Supercharged `main` `61a6d65` (later moved to `dcb5e1a`→`61a6d65`), verified read-only. Three tracks; **none is a file transfer** — SC owns divergent copies, so completion is additive build / in-place adaptation against SC's own code, never a raw commit transfer of the archived UPD-1004.

### UPD-1004 completion track — tenant-safe boundaries

The archived `UPD-1004` (`e42af39`, 41 files at once) is **not** retried. It is replaced by a bounded, independently-testable sequence. J KISS wraps **161** route files with `withTenantRoute`; Supercharged wraps **3** of its 129 → **126 unwrapped**. The wrapper (`with-tenant-route.ts` + `request-context.ts`) is **byte-identical** on both and a **no-op while `TENANCY_ENABLED=false`**, so adoption is backward-compatible.

| Update | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **UPD-1016** | Tenant-boundary **test harness** (tests only) | ✅ **APPROVED (owner) + PUBLISHED — Supercharged [PR #17](https://github.com/ratchetnu/supercharged/pull/17), head `a3a68c0`, NOT merged.** Assigned to **Session 3**. |
| **UPD-1017** | Wrap webhooks (twilio/stripe/email) | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending the UPD-1016 test-gate result** |
| **UPD-1018** | Wrap cron (background-tenant) | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |
| **UPD-1019** | Wrap public token routes | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |
| **UPD-1020** | Wrap portal routes | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |
| **UPD-1021** | Wrap admin/ai + estimator routes | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |
| **UPD-1022** | Wrap core admin (bookings/routes/comms/claims/messages/reminders) | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |
| **UPD-1023** | Wrap remaining admin | 🔴 **BLOCKED pending UPD-1016** |

**UPD-1004 → "Installed" only when all seven wrapping increments land AND the UPD-1016 suite passes with `TENANCY_ENABLED=true` in Preview.** Any partial leaves routes unwrapped → not tenant-safe → stays *Partly*.

### UPD-1016 result (Session 3, 2026-07-23)

**PUBLISHED, NOT MERGED — held for coordinator review.** SC PR #17, branch `codex/operion-upd-1016-tenant-boundary-tests`, head `a3a68c0`, 5 new `scripts/*.test.ts` (+623/−0, **tests only**). SC baseline **487/487 → 542/542** with the harness; **tsc clean**; CI `regression` **SUCCESS** (`30038216829`), Vercel skipped (scripts-only). The 3 existing wrapped routes still pass and are pinned by a regression guard + an "exactly 3 wrapped" tripwire. Both flag states exercised (`TENANCY_ENABLED` toggled only inside a test-local helper, restored in `finally` — no persistent env change). **Key gate findings recorded in the PR:** SC sessions carry no `tenantId` yet, so `withTenantRoute` fail-closes for every unauthenticated family → token/webhook/cron need **resource/explicit** resolution, not the session wrapper; SC's host map excludes the Supercharged host; only `app/api/upload` scopes blob paths; `PROOF_PATH_RE` is not tenant-prefix-aware. **No route wrapping, no flag/env/Production write, no update registration, no dispatch, no merge; archived UPD-1004 untouched; SC `main` still `61a6d65`.**

### UPD-1002 completion track — independent background estimator (PLANNED, NOT STARTED)

SC's `shadow-*` estimator is **divergent & self-contained** ("its own cron, its own queue, its own budget"). Reported gaps are partly a drift artifact: **queue + per-run budget exist in a different form**. Genuine gaps: **run-status reporting** (`shadow-run-status.ts` + `groundTruthQuote` + admin `ai-queue` route/page — all absent on SC) and the **persistent daily spend-ceiling + kill-switch** (`shadow-budget.ts` + store spend fns — absent). Proposed **UPD-1014** (run-status) → **UPD-1015** (spend ceiling), additive + symbol-adapted to SC's shapes (JK's modules cannot drop in — symbol-level breaks). The 6-file alert subsystem is product-specific → excluded unless owner wants it. **Not started.**

### IMG-002 completion track — photo optimisation results view (PLANNED, NOT STARTED, data-blocked)

The two "missing" files don't exist on JK either — they're the top of a **4-layer stack** (A/B record → persist → API → UI) with **no data source** (`IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED` OFF → zero eval records). Proposed **UPD-1010** (A/B shadow recording) → **UPD-1011** (persistence) → **UPD-1012** (read API) → **UPD-1013** (admin UI). Code-buildable, but **IMG-002 → "Installed" stays BLOCKED on an owner-approved data-source run in Preview** (a view over no records is permanently empty). **Not started.**

---

## 🔧 WORK ORDER — PR #56 revision (coordinator → Session 3)

**PR #56 reviewed. Verdict: approve-pending-one-change.** Everything else in it stands — do not rework it.

### What was accepted (do not touch)

`evidence.ts` as a pure module instead of a `provider.ts` test seam — **endorsed**, keep it · separate `platform:autoev:` key family off the bulk read path · 250/2000 caps with explicit truncation accounting · 90-day TTL · fail-soft write · `updatedAt` untouched · marker under the business lock · refusal capture · unchanged runner response.

Verified by coordinator: **1929/1929**, tsc 0, ESLint 0, build 0, AI regression 2/2, all remote checks green. Mutation checks: silencing truncation breaks 2 tests, leaking content hashes breaks 1 — the safety properties are genuinely enforced.

### The single required change: `skippedModules`

The evidence record reports which target modules **were** symbol-verified but not which were **skipped**. `analyzeSymbols` returns `skippedModules` (an unreadable target module is skipped by design and by test, never refused) and `manifest-builder.ts:196` **discards it** — it propagates only `symbols.checkedModules`. An evidence record whose own coverage has a silent gap defeats the increment.

**Do:**

1. **`manifest-builder.ts`** — surface the skipped list on `BuiltManifest` alongside `symbolCheckedPaths`. It is already computed; this is plumbing, not new logic. Suggested name `symbolSkippedModules` for symmetry with `symbolCheckedPaths` — your call, but be consistent.
2. **`types.ts`** — add the field to `TransferEvidence` and add its key to `EvidenceTruncation`. Shape: `{ module: string; reason: string }[]`. **Keep the reason** — "why was this skipped" is the operationally useful half, and reasons come from a small closed set in code, never from user input. Bound it like the other lists.
3. **`types.ts`** — fix the comment: it says *"closure's own module cap is 200"*; `DEFAULT_MAX_TARGET_MODULES` is **150**.
4. **Tests** — prove the skipped list is captured, bounded, and truncation-accounted, in the same behavioural style as the existing 17.

### ⚠️ One subtlety — handle it consciously

`app/api/automation/manifest/route.ts` returns `{ jobId, ...built.data }`, so **any new `BuiltManifest` field is sent to the CI runner.** PR #56's own comment claims *"Response shape is unchanged — the runner sees exactly what it saw before."* Adding a field makes that claim false unless you address it.

Two acceptable resolutions — pick one and say which in the PR body:
- **(a)** Accept the response growing. #55 already added `symbolCheckedPaths` to `BuiltManifest`, so the precedent exists and `operion-apply.mjs` tolerates unknown fields. Update the stale comment.
- **(b)** Keep the wire response byte-identical by omitting the field from what is spread to the runner.

Either way, **add a test asserting the runner-facing response shape is what you intended.** Do not leave it implicit.

### Scope limits — strict

⛔ No unrelated logic · ⛔ **no change to any transfer verdict or gate behaviour** (`analyzeSymbols` decides exactly what it decides today; you are only plumbing its existing output) · ⛔ no flag, env, or config change · ⛔ no Production action · ⛔ **do not merge** — open the revision, then hand PR status back to the coordinator for final review.

**Re-run full verification:** focused evidence + platform regression set · `npm test` · `npx tsc --noEmit` · focused ESLint · `npm run build` · `npm run test:ai:regression`.

---

## 🔷 ROLE RESET + HARDENING INCREMENT 2 — AUDIT FIRST (2026-07-22 19:1xZ)

### Roles, re-established

Session 3 was accidentally issued coordinator instructions. Correcting explicitly:

| Role | Owns | Does **NOT** own |
|---|---|---|
| **Coordinator** (this session) | Sequencing · merge decisions · executing every merge · releasing sessions · this status document · Production verification | Authoring feature code |
| **Session 3** | **Implementation only**, within `app/lib/platform/**`, `app/api/automation/**`, `app/api/admin/platform/**`, `tools/product-sync/**`, `scripts/` platform tests | ⛔ **merging anything** · deciding sequence · releasing sessions · editing this file · Production actions · flag changes · registering or dispatching transfers |

**Session 3 must not merge.** Open a PR and hand it to the coordinator; the coordinator reviews independently and merges. This has been the working pattern for #52/#47/#53/#54/#55 and it stays.

### Increment 2 — mandate: **AUDIT FIRST, NO CODE**

**Goal:** bounded, backward-compatible `transferEvidence` persisted on the job/deployment record, closing §4 #7 (audit-trail gap) so a failed transfer can be reviewed without git archaeology.

⛔ **No code changes in this phase.** ⛔ No merge. ⛔ No flags. ⛭ No Production changes. Session 3 delivers a written audit and **stops** for coordinator review.

#### Ground truth already established (do not re-derive; verify if you doubt it)

- `UpdateAutomationJob` — `app/lib/platform/automation/types.ts:50`
- Persistence — `app/lib/platform/automation/store.ts`, `saveJob`/`getJob`, JSON in Redis under `auto:*`
- **The gap, precisely:** `app/api/automation/manifest/route.ts:63` returns `{ jobId, ...built.data }` **to the CI runner**. The evidence is computed server-side, transmitted over the wire, and **never written to the job record.** Nothing persists it.
- `BuiltManifest` today carries: `manifest` · `contents` · `excludedPaths` · `driftCheckedPaths` · `targetBaseCommit` · `closureCheckedPaths` · `symbolCheckedPaths`
- **Plus a known omission from #55:** `analyzeSymbols` returns `skippedModules` (unreadable target module → skipped by design and by test, not refused) and `manifest-builder` **discards it**. Coverage is currently unreportable. **This belongs in the evidence payload.**

#### Audit deliverables — a document, not a diff

1. **Current-state map.** Every field of `UpdateAutomationJob` and `DeploymentRecord`, which are written where, and which of the pipeline's computed artefacts are discarded today. Cite file:line.
2. **Proposed `transferEvidence` shape.** Field-by-field, with the type. Minimum: manifest paths · `closureCheckedPaths` · `driftCheckedPaths` · `symbolCheckedPaths` · **`skippedModules`** · `excludedPaths` · source SHA · target SHA (`targetBaseCommit`) · preflight result.
3. **Size analysis — the load-bearing one.** Measure, do not estimate: for a realistic 41-file transfer, the byte cost of each field and the total record size. State the Redis value ceiling you are designing against and the bound you propose (cap? truncate-with-count? store paths only?). **A silent cap is forbidden** — if coverage is bounded, the record must say what was dropped and how many.
4. **`recordVersion` / backward-compatibility plan.** How existing job records without the field read back. Follow the `normalize()` backfill convention (`app/lib/bookings.ts`) — `docs/operations/07-migration-safety-checklist.md` governs any persisted-shape change.
5. **Confidentiality review.** Confirm the payload is **paths and SHAs only** — never file contents (`contents` is base64 bytes and must never be persisted), never tokens, never customer data.
6. **Write-path decision.** Where the write happens, and how it behaves when persistence fails. State plainly whether a failed evidence write may ever block a transfer. **Recommended: it must not** — evidence is observational; failing a transfer because we could not write a log would be a new failure mode. Argue it either way, but decide explicitly.
7. **Flag-off / inertness statement.** Confirm the change is inert with automation flags off, and say by what mechanism.
8. **Test plan.** Behavioural, driving real functions — **not source-text assertions.** (`scripts/portal-presigned-upload.test.ts`'s original style is the anti-pattern; it is exactly why the `req.json()` 500 survived to Preview.)

#### Explicit non-goals

Not in this increment: changing any gate's verdict · altering transfer behaviour · the canary · registering or dispatching anything · UPD-1004 · completion-photo lifecycle (separate, approval-gated plan).

#### Stop condition

Session 3 posts the audit and **stops**. The coordinator reviews it, and only then authorises implementation — as a PR, merged by the coordinator.

## ✅ PR #55 MERGED — `main` = **`c48b6c7`** (2026-07-22 19:05Z)

**Hardening increment 1 of the revised transfer plan is done.** Exported-symbol verification; closes issue #48 §9.

```bash
vercel rollback dpl_BnLZtuEX169htUT83eA3q43uGxq1 --yes
git revert -m 1 c48b6c7
```

**What it closes:** closure proves a module *exists* on the target; it never proved the target's copy *exports* the names the transfer reads. `e014ad25` clears closure then fails the target's typecheck on one missing export. The required negative regression — `app/api/admin/_lib/session.ts` / `isPlatformOwner`, in its real `e014ad25` shape — is present and asserts the exact message.

**Design verified independently:** runs after closure (cheaper gate speaks first) and before the drift loop (a doomed transfer costs no drift reads) · modules read are by construction *not* in the manifest, so **no read amplification** · fails before job, branch or dispatch creation · 150-module cap **fails closed** (`limit_exceeded`) · reuses `closure.ts`'s `lexicalView`/`matchStartsInCode` rather than copying them, so both gates mask comments/strings/templates identically.

**Verification:** symbol 37/37 · closure+builder+preflight 58/58 · **full suite 1912/1912** on a merge preview against *current* main (`1614239`; the PR was based on `4430931`, merged clean) · tsc 0 · ESLint 0 · build 0 · AI regression 2/2 · all remote checks pass. **Mutation check:** forcing `analyzeSymbols` to always pass breaks **6 of 37** tests — they bind to real behaviour, not vacuously.

**Post-deploy:** `/` 200 · `/api/health` 200 · platform updates **401** · manifest **405** · `POST /api/portal/upload` **404** (booking feature still inert) · env **42 vars unchanged**, both `BLOB_STORE_ID` and `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` absent · `flags.ts`/`vercel.json`/`.env`/workflows **untouched across the entire sprint** (`ee577c2..c48b6c7`) · no transfer dispatched · UPD-1004 untouched.

> **Non-blocking finding, tracked not fixed:** `analyzeSymbols` returns `skippedModules` (an unreadable target module is skipped by design and by test, not refused), but `manifest-builder` **discards it** — only `symbolCheckedPaths` reaches `BuiltManifest`. An operator therefore sees what *was* verified with no signal about what was not. This is the natural payload for **hardening increment 2** (bounded `transferEvidence`), which already lists `closureCheckedPaths`/`driftCheckedPaths`/`excludedPaths`. Strictly additive either way — before this PR there was zero symbol checking.

**Next in the transfer sequence:** hardening increment 2 (bounded `transferEvidence` persistence), then the `106846c0` one-file canary — dispatched only from J KISS **Production** to Supercharged **Preview**, which will require the owner-approved Production flag change already flagged below.

**Inertness proven, not assumed:** `POST /api/portal/upload` on Production returns **404** — the `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` gate fires before any Blob logic. The feature is unreachable in Production.

**Verified after deploy:** `/` 200 · `/api/health` 200 · `/admin/operations/schedule` 200 · platform updates **401** · manifest **405** · prod env **42 vars, unchanged** · `BLOB_STORE_ID` **absent (not written)** · `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` **absent** · `flags.ts`/`vercel.json`/`.env`/workflows **untouched across the entire sprint** (`ee577c2..1614239`) · UPD-1004 last run still `05:26:27Z` · **no Supercharged workflow since 18:00Z** · no transfer dispatched.

**Runtime-validated on Preview before merge:** unauthenticated → 401 with safe copy; malformed JSON and empty body → 400 safe shape (were 500); flag proven ON in Preview; no SDK/parser internals in any response. Negative controls run for both fixes.

**Still open — tracked, not forgotten:**
- A byte upload through the crew presigned path has **never** been exercised. Pre-existing transport; gated behind activation readiness (issue #46). Needs a **fresh Preview-only credential**.
- **Completion-photo lifecycle** — append-only, no removal path; 3 confirmed dead references on Preview booking `b5d04027…`. See `completion-photo-lifecycle-hardening.md`. **Approval-gated, no code.**

**PR #55** (`codex/operion-symbol-verification-gate`, head `47d3d6e`) — ~~**HELD** at owner instruction until the #54 sequence completes.~~ **OBSOLETE — PR #55 was MERGED 2026-07-22T19:05:22Z (`c48b6c7`).** No J KISS or Supercharged PR in this file's scope is held any longer; see the reconciliation table at the top.

## ✅ FREEZE LIFTED — corrected `main` = **`4430931`** (2026-07-22 16:42Z)

**The #47 route-lane regression is fixed, merged, deployed and verified. `c791d4e` is superseded — do not build on it.**

### 🟢 SESSIONS 2 AND 3 ARE RELEASED

| Session | Status | Instruction |
|---|---|---|
| **S1** | ✅ hotfix delivered (PR #53) | Return to standby. Still **no** worktree pruning, branch deletion, or stash work. |
| **S2** | 🟢 **RELEASED** | Rebase onto **`4430931`**. `c791d4e` is an ancestor, so the rebase is a fast-forward. Resume within your owned paths only. |
| **S3** | 🟢 **RELEASED** | Rebase onto **`4430931`**. Proceed to the two hardening increments below — **not** to registration or dispatch. |

**Still prohibited for everyone:** enabling any flag · setting Production `BLOB_STORE_ID` · registering or dispatching transfers · Preview E2E · pruning worktrees · applying or dropping stashes.

### Hotfix record — PR #53

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **PR** | **#53** — `fix(schedule): keep missing_crew route detection on "nobody is on it"` |
| **Branch** | `fix/schedule-missing-crew-route-regression` |
| **Head → merge SHA** | `ca711fe` → **`4430931`** |
| **Merged** | 2026-07-22 16:42:47Z |
| **Corrected `origin/main`** | **`4430931`** |
| **Production deployment** | **`dpl_FZAtMj92NY9cCMqhvQHavRj6JRMM`** ● **Ready**, created 16:42:50Z, aliased to jkissllc.com |
| **Scope** | 3 files, +105/−2 — `app/lib/schedule/conflicts.ts` (+13/−2), `scripts/schedule.test.ts`, `scripts/booking-assignment-flag-off.test.ts` |

### Rollback commands

```bash
# Fastest — repoint the production alias, no rebuild
vercel rollback dpl_DTjcqRv266kP41oAoGPWC39gYzPY --yes   # back to c791d4e (regression present)
vercel rollback dpl_DFTgafHN2JemUBQmktwqzHHkMMxW --yes   # back to ee577c2 (before the whole sequence)

# Durable — revert the hotfix merge
git revert -m 1 4430931
```

### The fix

```ts
const noCrew = it.kind === 'route' ? it.crew.length === 0 : !it.crewComplete
```

`ScheduleKind` is exactly `'booking' | 'route'` with only two constructors, so the ternary is total. Routes return to the pre-#47 predicate **byte-for-byte**; bookings keep #47's `crewComplete` test, which is what makes an assignment rollback inert without blinding route detection.

> **Coordinator note — S1's fix is better than the one this document originally proposed.** The earlier suggestion, `crew.length === 0 && !crewComplete` applied to *all* items, also restores routes, but it would have **changed the booking lane too**: a booking with crew present and `crewComplete === false` emits `missing_crew` under #47 and would have been silently suppressed. That was unauthorized scope. S1's lane-aware form touches routes only. The original proposal is superseded.

### Independent verification (coordinator, not S1's reporting)

**Negative control — the decisive check.** With **only the two test files** applied to `c791d4e` and the `conflicts.ts` fix withheld, **3 of the 5 new tests FAIL**: short-handed route flagged · flag on/off parity broken · merged schedule flags **2** items instead of 1. The other 2 pass either way — they are controls that must never change. The tests genuinely pin the regression rather than merely passing alongside it.

**Tree identity:** `4430931^{tree}` == `ca711fe^{tree}` == `60d8193…` — the merge introduced no content beyond the verified preview.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| focused conflict tests | **57 / 57** |
| `npm test` (on `4430931`) | **1861 / 1861**, 0 fail (+5) |
| `npm run test:ai:regression` | **2 / 2** |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | exit **0** |
| focused ESLint (3 files) | exit **0** |
| `npm run build` | exit **0** |
| Remote CI `verify` · Vercel · Vercel Preview Comments | **pass / pass / pass** |
| merge state | **CLEAN / MERGEABLE** |

**Behavioural criteria — all confirmed:** route with an assigned driver no longer emits `missing_crew` ✅ · genuinely uncrewed route still does ✅ · booking-assignment flag-off remains inert ✅ · no cross-lane leakage (merged schedule flags exactly the booking, asserted via `itemIds[0].startsWith('booking:')`) ✅ · vehicle/equipment conflicts unchanged, `missing_vehicle` asserted in both directions ✅ · `customerView` still strips assignment internals (full suite) ✅

### Post-deploy Production verification

- `/` **200** · `/api/health` **200** · `/admin/operations/schedule` **200** · `/api/admin/platform/updates` **401** · `/api/automation/manifest` **405**
- **Env unchanged — 42 variables, identical set to the pre-sequence audit.** `BLOB_STORE_ID` **absent** (0) · `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` **absent** (0) · all 9 `OPERION_*` present and OFF
- **`flags.ts` never appears** in the diff across the entire sequence `ee577c2..4430931`; no `vercel.json`, `.env`, or workflow file touched
- **UPD-1004 not retried** — last `Operion Update` run remains `2026-07-22T05:26:27Z` (failure), 11h before the sequence; **zero** Supercharged workflow runs after 16:00Z; no `operion/upd-1004` branch; no new Supercharged PR
- **No automated transfer dispatched**

Total delta across the whole sequence `ee577c2..4430931`: **13 files, +984/−23**.

### The regression — coordinator-verified independently

`app/lib/schedule/conflicts.ts:171`, changed by #47:

```diff
- if (it.lane === 'confirmed' && it.scheduled && it.crew.length === 0) {
+ if (it.lane === 'confirmed' && it.scheduled && !it.crewComplete) {
```

`detectConflicts` runs over the **unified** item list — bookings *and* routes. In `unified.ts`:

- `routeToScheduleItem:272` → `lane = r.status === 'draft' ? 'pending' : 'confirmed'` — every non-draft route is `'confirmed'`
- `routeToScheduleItem:310` → `crewComplete = (r.assignees?.length ?? 0) > 0 && !gap.incomplete`

So a **scheduled non-draft route with one assigned driver and an incomplete crew gap** has `crew.length === 1` but `crewComplete === false`:

| | pre-#47 (`crew.length === 0`) | post-#47 (`!crewComplete`) |
|---|---|---|
| Route, 1 driver, gap incomplete | `false` → no conflict | **`true` → emits `missing_crew`** ❌ |

The emitted message is also factually false: *"…is confirmed for {date} with no crew assigned."* — about a route that **has** a driver.

**Why the flag does not suppress it:** #47 added `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` gating **only inside `bookingToScheduleItem`**. `routeToScheduleItem` was not touched and has no flag path. The route lane therefore changed behavior with the flag OFF ⇒ **the merge was not fully inert.** Severity is `warning` (not `error`), and the surface is admin-facing, but it is spurious noise on a live lane and it can mask genuine warnings.

**Test gap:** the full suite passed 1856/1856 through this change. No test covers a partially-crewed route against `missing_crew`. The hotfix must add one.

### Required hotfix shape (coordinator's independent analysis — S1 may propose better)

A single condition restores routes exactly while **preserving #47's valid booking-side fix**:

```ts
if (it.lane === 'confirmed' && it.scheduled && it.crew.length === 0 && !it.crewComplete) {
```

| Case | `crew` | `crewComplete` | pre-#47 | post-#47 | with fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Route, 1 driver, gap incomplete | 1 | false | none | **missing_crew** ❌ | none ✅ restored |
| Route, 0 assignees | 0 | false | missing_crew | missing_crew | missing_crew ✅ |
| Route, full crew | 2 | true | none | none | none ✅ |
| Booking flag-OFF, roster hidden, legacy `assignedTo` set | 0 | true | missing_crew (false positive #47 fixed) | none | **none ✅ #47's fix preserved** |
| Booking, genuinely uncrewed | 0 | false | missing_crew | missing_crew | missing_crew ✅ |

For routes the added clause is provably a no-op (`crew.length === 0` ⇒ `assignees === 0` ⇒ `crewComplete === false`), so **route behavior becomes byte-identical to pre-#47**. Only the booking lane keeps #47's improvement.

**Reverting all of #47 is NOT authorized** unless this narrow fix cannot preserve the booking-side changes. On the above analysis it can.

### Merge criteria for the hotfix — all must hold

route behavior restored · booking flag-off behavior still correct · full suite · `tsc` · ESLint · AI regression · `npm run build` · Preview green · ~~all flags OFF~~ **no flag changed by the hotfix** · no env var changed.

> **Correction (2026-07-23):** "all flags OFF" was never an accurate description of J KISS
> Production — the 2026-07-22 audit found the Operion automation switches **ON**, with the
> side-effecting actions approval-gated. The criterion that actually mattered here was *the
> hotfix changes no flag*, which is what this line now says. Historical section; the hotfix
> merged long ago.

## 🔴 Blocking activation defects — Blob readiness (S2 read-only audit, coordinator-recorded)

Both are **blocking for booking-assignment Production activation**. Neither is being fixed yet.

| # | Defect | Location | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BLOB-1** | Crew upload route **fails closed** when `BLOB_STORE_ID` is absent | `app/api/portal/upload/route.ts:34-37` — throws `blob_store_not_configured` | Every crew completion upload → HTTP 400 → generic "Upload failed" in the field, the moment the flag is turned on |
| **BLOB-2** | Photo validation **degrades to a host-suffix floor** when `BLOB_STORE_ID` is absent | `app/lib/job-assignment.ts:313-316`; `scripts/job-assignment.test.ts:310` asserts a Preview-store URL passes | A **Production** record can reference **Preview-hosted** bytes |

Store IDs verified live: Production `jkiss-invoice-photos` = `store_WK8DoJzb2Q1lu5sv`; Preview `operion-preview-blob` = `store_Ulabe9q3GBD8ZYQh`.

**Standing restrictions:** ⛔ Production `BLOB_STORE_ID` write **NOT approved** — owner decision pending. ⛔ Booking-claims implementation **NOT authorized** (answers S2's B-3: it stays Sprint 3 scope, do **not** start). ⛔ `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` stays **OFF** throughout.

### Agreed sequence

1. Merge + verify the narrow #47 route-conflict hotfix ← **in progress**
2. Publish the corrected `main` SHA here
3. Update the ownership map
4. Assign BLOB-1 + BLOB-2 as **one narrow isolated increment** — only if file ownership is disjoint (coordinator verifies before assigning)
5. Validate that increment in **Preview**
6. Run the full booking-assignment **Preview E2E**
7. **STOP for owner approval** before setting Production `BLOB_STORE_ID`
8. `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` OFF throughout

## 🔺 Transfer plan REVISED — UPD-A / UPD-B are dead (S3 read-only audit, accepted)

**`OPERION_CURRENT_STATE.md` §12 Sprint 2 is superseded by this section.** It prescribed splitting `UPD-1004` into `UPD-A` (Book Now intake) and `UPD-B` (tenancy-only) and enabling the automation flags "in Preview only". The real closure and drift gates — the ones merged in #51 and #50 — prove **both scopes are invalid**.

### Findings (recorded)

| Finding | Detail |
|---|---|
| **UPD-A invalid** | **19 closure failures**, **7 drift failures**, unresolved import chain |
| **UPD-B invalid** | **22 of 32 files fail drift** |
| **Exclusions are not a rescue** | `pathsToExclude` cannot carve either scope down to a meaningful, test-safe transfer |
| **Preview-only dispatch is impossible** | preflight **blocks when `VERCEL_ENV=preview`** — the handoff's "enable the flags in Preview only" plan cannot work at all |
| **Correct topology** | source control plane must be **J KISS Production**, targeting **Supercharged Preview** |
| **No verified transfer exists** | no transfer has ever ended in a verified `DeploymentRecord` |
| **Closure gap** | closure checks module **existence only** — it does **not** verify that the imported **exported symbols** exist on the target |

⛔ **`UPD-A` and `UPD-B` must not be registered or dispatched.** ⛔ **`UPD-1004` is not retried.**

### Replacement sequence (authorized as a plan; execution gated)

1. **Finish and merge the route-conflict hotfix first** ← blocking everything below
2. **Hardening increment 1 — exported-symbol verification** (narrow, isolated)
   - detect imports whose **exported symbols** do not exist on the target
   - include the `app/lib/platform/session.ts` / `isPlatformOwner` **negative regression** test
   - **fail before** job, branch, or dispatch creation
3. **Hardening increment 2 — bounded `transferEvidence` persistence** (optional field on the job/deployment record)
   - manifest paths · `closureCheckedPaths` · `driftCheckedPaths` · `excludedPaths` · source and target SHAs · preflight result
   - **backward-compatible `recordVersion` handling** (readers backfill; see `normalize()` convention)
   - closes §4 #7 of the handoff — the audit-trail gap
4. **Canary:** commit **`106846c0`** as the **first one-file transfer**
5. Dispatch **only** from the **J KISS Production** control plane
6. Target **Supercharged Preview only**
7. Require the **complete lifecycle**: preflight → one job → one branch → one dispatch → PR → Preview → verification → **verified `DeploymentRecord`**
8. ⛔ **Do not promote to Supercharged Production**
9. Only after the canary is verified, assess commit **`17ac1972`** as the next transfer

**Gate:** nothing in steps 4–9 may be registered or dispatched until the route hotfix **and both hardening increments** are verified. ~~Automation flags stay **OFF** until then.~~ **Correction (2026-07-23): the Operion automation flags were already ON in J KISS Production (audited 2026-07-22); the real gate is owner approval of each side-effecting action, and no flag was changed.**

### ✅ RESOLVED (2026-07-23) — the "flags OFF" contradiction was based on a wrong premise

~~Steps 4–7 require dispatching from the **J KISS Production** control plane. Dispatch is gated by `OPERION_AUTOMATION_ENABLED` + `OPERION_PREVIEW_AUTOMATION_ENABLED` + `OPERION_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ENABLED`, which are **present but OFF in J KISS Production**. So the canary **cannot run** while "keep all automation flags OFF" holds literally.~~

**The premise was false.** The 2026-07-22 Production audit established that
`OPERION_AUTOMATION_ENABLED`, `OPERION_PREVIEW_AUTOMATION_ENABLED` and
`OPERION_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ENABLED` are **ON** in J KISS Production (created by the account owner
2026-07-16); what is gated is each side-effecting **action**, by owner approval. No flag change
was ever required, **and none was made**.

The contradiction is moot for a second reason: **the canary already ran and passed** — UPD-1007 @
`106846c0`, workflow run `29697932299` (`success`), Supercharged PR #3, Production promotion
intentionally not requested. Nothing in steps 4–7 is waiting on a flag decision. See the
reconciliation section at the top of this file.

## ✅ MERGE RECORD — Sprint 1 authorized sequence COMPLETE (2026-07-22 16:19Z)

`origin/main`: `ee577c2` → **`c791d4e`**. Two merges, owner-authorized, executed one at a time.

| # | PR | Merge commit | Merged | Production deployment | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **#52** dependency preflight | **`b015564`** | 16:15:01Z | `dpl_FfyYpLokVu1qNynihWtvgSFviM5a` | ● Ready |
| 2 | **#47** rollback inertness | **`c791d4e`** | 16:19:03Z | `dpl_DTjcqRv266kP41oAoGPWC39gYzPY` | ● Ready, aliased to jkissllc.com |

**Pre-merge rollback target (production before the sequence):** `dpl_DFTgafHN2JemUBQmktwqzHHkMMxW`

### Exact rollback commands

```bash
# Fastest: repoint the production alias. No rebuild, no code change.
vercel rollback dpl_DFTgafHN2JemUBQmktwqzHHkMMxW --yes    # undo BOTH merges
vercel rollback dpl_FfyYpLokVu1qNynihWtvgSFviM5a --yes    # undo #47 only, keep #52

# Durable: revert the merge commits (redeploys automatically; reverse order)
git revert -m 1 c791d4e    # revert #47
git revert -m 1 b015564    # revert #52
```

### Verified after the sequence

- Full suite **1854/1854** on #52; **1856/1856** + `tsc` clean on the #47 **merge result** (tested against the new `main`, not the branch in isolation)
- Total delta `ee577c2..c791d4e` = **exactly 12 files**, `+880/−22` — the 8 from #52 plus the 4 from #47, nothing else
- **`app/lib/platform/flags.ts` is not in the diff** — no flag default can have changed
- No `vercel.json` / `.env` / workflow file touched
- Production: `/` → **200** · `/api/admin/platform/updates` → **401** · `/api/automation/manifest` → **405**
- `BLOB_STORE_ID` still **absent** in Production (0 occurrences) — not set, per instruction
- `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED` still **absent** in Production — defaults `false`
- **UPD-1004 not retried**: last `Operion Update` run was `2026-07-22T05:26:27Z` (failure), ~11h *before* the sequence; **zero** Supercharged workflow runs after 16:00Z; no `operion/upd-1004` branch exists; no new Supercharged PR
- Stashes untouched: 2 in J KISS, 1 in Supercharged
- **No worktree pruned. No branch deleted.**

### PRs closed as superseded

| PR | Disposition |
|---|---|
| **#33** | Closed. Evidence preserved: full 42KB patch + file-by-file comparison at `docs/operations/superseded/`. ⚠️ **Only partially superseded** — see follow-up below. |
| **#29** | Closed, superseded by `OPERION_CURRENT_STATE.md`. |

**Open follow-up from #33:** `app/lib/platform/automation/target-policy.ts` + its test were never merged and nothing on `main` replaces them. `pathsToExclude` (#49) is per-update owner *configuration* that **fails open** when a path is omitted; the target policy is a categorical role-derived boundary that **fails closed**. Re-raise as a fresh additive PR carrying only those two files plus one call site.

**Remaining open PRs: #38, #43** — both deliberately not merged.

### ⚠️ Concurrent sessions are LIVE — rebase your base

Two worktrees appeared during the sequence that the coordinator did not create:

- `/Users/nunubabymuzik/jkissllc-booking-prod` @ `c791d4e` [`codex/sprint1-booking-prod-readiness`] — **Session 2 has started** and correctly adopted the ownership map's branch name.
- `/private/tmp/claude-501/…/a800b6d9-…/scratchpad/verify-main` @ `c791d4e` (detached) — a different session verifying the merged main.

**Base correction for S2 and S3:** §3 originally told you to stack on the PR heads `fa4b028` / `1e80da5`. Those PRs are now **merged**. Branch directly off `origin/main` = **`c791d4e`** instead. Session 2 already did this correctly.

### Open PR reality check (all checks green unless noted)

| PR | Branch | Mergeable | Files | Domain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **#52** | `codex/operion-dependency-preflight` | **CLEAN** | 8 — `platform/automation/{orchestrator,preflight}.ts`, `updates/policy.ts`, 2 admin routes, admin page, 2 tests | **S3** |
| **#47** | `codex/operion-sprint1-flag-projection` | **CLEAN** | 4 — `schedule/conflicts.ts`, `schedule/unified.ts`, 2 booking tests | **S2** |

**The four mergeable PRs (#52, #47, #38, #43) have completely disjoint file footprints.** They cannot conflict with each other.

**#33 is conflicting because it rewrites `manifest-builder.ts` / `operion-apply.mjs`, which merged PRs #49/#50/#51 already replaced, and it collides with #52 on `preflight.ts`.** It is superseded, not merely stale.

## 1. 🔴 BLOCKING DECISION — owner approval required before any merge

**J KISS auto-deploys Production on every push to `main`** (Vercel Git integration, project `jkissllc`, `prj_KkbKoiRYHJOvppR6vco5JI1W11fr`).

Therefore **merging PR #52 or #47 is a Production write**, and the standing rule is *no Production write without explicit owner approval*. This is true even though every relevant flag is OFF and the change is functionally inert in Production.

**Nothing merges until the owner says so.** Until then all three sessions are restricted to read-only / branch-local work.

Second approval needed, independently: **setting `BLOB_STORE_ID=store_WK8DoJzb2Q1lu5sv` in the Production scope** (P1 #1/#2). That is a secret-scope write to Production.

---

## 2. Session ownership map

Ownership is by **file path**, not by intent. A session may only write paths in its own domain. Overlap = stop and escalate to the coordinator.

### SESSION 1 — Repository cleanup & PR integration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Branch / worktree** | Operates on **git metadata only**. Admin worktree: `/Users/nunubabymuzik/jkissllc-integration` on `integration/sprint-1-cleanup` (to be created, off `origin/main`). |
| **Owned paths** | **No application source files.** Owns: worktree registry, local/remote branch refs, stash refs, PR state (merge/close/label), issue state. Owns this status file's §0 and §3. |
| **Explicitly NOT owned** | Any file under `app/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`. S1 merges other sessions' work; it never authors it. |
| **Current task** | T1.1 fast-forward local `main` → `origin/main`. T1.2 preserve the 18 untracked files in the primary worktree (see §4 hazard). T1.3 prune the 20 merged worktrees + branches. T1.4 close #29; close #33 on S3's written recommendation. T1.5 stash triage (record contents, do not apply). |
| **Commit SHA** | — not started |
| **Test status** | n/a until a merge is authorized; full suite required before each merge |
| **Blockers** | **B-1 (owner approval for Production deploy)** blocks all merge tasks. Cleanup tasks T1.1–T1.3, T1.5 are unblocked. |
| **Merge readiness** | Blocked on B-1 |

### SESSION 2 — Booking assignment production readiness

| **Branch / worktree** | `/Users/nunubabymuzik/jkissllc-booking-prod`, branch `codex/sprint1-booking-prod-readiness`, **based on PR #47 head `fa4b028`** (not `main`) — see §3 sequencing. |

| **Current task** | T2.1 (read-only) re-verify the three P1 defects against reality — `BLOB_STORE_ID` absence confirmed; re-run the §4 #2 cross-store-URL probe; re-confirm `customerView` strips `assignees`. T2.2 draft the Production activation gate list. **No source writes until B-1 resolves.** |

### SESSION 3 — Supercharged automated transfer preparation

| | |
|---|---|
| **Branch / worktree** | J KISS: `/Users/nunubabymuzik/jkissllc-transfer-prep`, branch `codex/sprint1-transfer-prep`, **based on PR #52 head `1e80da5`**. Supercharged: `/Users/nunubabymuzik/supercharged-transfer-prep`, branch `codex/sprint1-transfer-target-prep` off SC `origin/main` `52d50b7`. |
| **Owned paths** | `app/lib/platform/**` (updates, automation, closure, preflight, orchestrator, providers) · `app/api/admin/platform/**` · `app/api/automation/**` · `app/admin/operations/platform/**` · `scripts/operion-apply.mjs` · `scripts/{manifest-builder,dependency-closure,platform-*,preflight-*,required-updates,github-provider}.test.ts` · `tools/product-sync/**` · **the entire Supercharged repo** |
| **Explicitly NOT owned** | Booking/schedule/portal/claims paths (S2) · git-admin actions (S1) |
| **Current task** | T3.1 (read-only) write the **#33 triage recommendation** (close vs. rebase) with evidence — hand to S1. T3.2 draft the `UPD-1004` split into `UPD-A` / `UPD-B` with explicit `dependencies[]` and `pathsToExclude[]`. **UPD-1004 itself is never retried.** T3.3 specify the §4 #7 audit-trail persistence. **No source writes until B-1 resolves.** |
| **Commit SHA** | — not started |
| **Test status** | baseline to establish: `npm test` on `1e80da5` (handoff claims 1854/1854) |
| **Blockers** | **B-1** (merge of #52) · **B-4** Supercharged has never completed a full Operion Preview E2E — Preview-only flag enablement is Sprint 2, needs its own approval · **B-5** SC local `main` is 2 behind `origin/main` |
| **Merge readiness** | Not ready — PR #52 must land first |

### Overlap analysis — verdict

| Pair | Shared paths | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| S1 ↔ S2 | none (S1 owns no source) | ✅ may run concurrently |
| S1 ↔ S3 | none (S1 owns no source) | ✅ may run concurrently |
| S2 ↔ S3 | none — `schedule/**`+`bookings` vs `platform/**` are disjoint; PR #47 and #52 file lists do not intersect | ✅ may run concurrently |

**No session is stopped for overlap.** All three are gated instead on the single Production-deploy approval (B-1).

## 3. Sequencing rule (why S2/S3 do not branch off `main`)

`origin/main` = `ee577c2` does **not** contain #47 or #52. If S2 branched off `main` and edited `schedule/unified.ts`, it would conflict with #47 the moment #47 merged. Same for S3 and `preflight.ts` / #52.

So each session **stacks on its own pending PR**:

```
origin/main ee577c2
├── #47 fa4b028 ──► S2 branch codex/sprint1-booking-prod-readiness
└── #52 1e80da5 ──► S3 branch codex/sprint1-transfer-prep
```

After S1 lands #47 and #52, both sessions rebase onto the new `main` — a no-op rebase, since their base commits become ancestors of `main`.

**Merge order when B-1 clears:** #52 → verify main green → #47 → verify main green → then #38, then #43 (owner's call). One merge at a time; re-check `origin/main` before each.

## 4. Active hazards

| # | Hazard | Owner | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H-1** | **`OPERION_CURRENT_STATE.md` is UNTRACKED and uncommitted** — it exists only in the working tree of `/Users/nunubabymuzik/jkissllc`. Any `git clean` destroys the authoritative handoff. 17 other untracked deliverables sit beside it (guides, PDFs, sprint-1 validation docs, `scripts/observability-verify.mjs`). | S1 | Back these up **before** any cleanup, and commit them on a docs branch. **Never run `git clean` in the primary worktree.** |
| **H-2** | The **primary worktree is on an already-merged branch** (`codex/operion-dependency-closure`). It looks like live work and is not. | S1 | Do not delete this branch while it is checked out. Move the primary worktree to `main` only after H-1 is resolved. |
| **H-3** | **8 worktrees live in `/private/tmp/`**, including the ones holding PR #52 and #47 heads. A reboot destroys them. | S1 | The PR branches exist on `origin` — recoverable. Recreate S2/S3 worktrees under `$HOME`, never `/private/tmp/`. |
| **H-4** | **Three stashes**, all unexplained (2 J KISS + 1 Supercharged). | S1 | Record `git stash show -p` output to a file. **Do not apply.** |
| **H-5** | **Concurrent-session hazard is real** — the primary worktree was dirty at audit time. | all | Re-check `git status` + mtimes immediately before every write. |
| **H-6** | New worktrees need `node_modules` as an **APFS clone** (`cp -c -R`), not a symlink — Turbopack rejects symlinks. | S2, S3 | Apply at worktree creation, before running tests. |

## 5. Standing rules in force

1. Never merge J KISS and Supercharged histories — unrelated histories, content-based sync only.
2. **Do not retry `UPD-1004`.** It gets split into ordered prerequisite updates instead.
3. Every Operion and booking-assignment flag stays **OFF**.
4. No Production write — deploy, env var, or promotion — without explicit owner approval.
5. Do not apply any stash.
6. Do not delete a branch without proven merged status **and** worktree safety.
7. Focused tests after every increment; **full suite before every merge**.
8. Re-check `origin/main` before every write, push, and merge.
9. No unrelated feature work.

## 6. Change log

| When | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-22 | coordinator | Audit complete; ownership map published; all sessions gated on B-1. |
| 2026-07-23 | S3 | **UPD-1016 (tenant-boundary test harness) APPROVED by owner, IMPLEMENTED + PUBLISHED — Supercharged [PR #17](https://github.com/ratchetnu/supercharged/pull/17), head `a3a68c0`, NOT merged.** First bounded increment replacing archived UPD-1004 (`e42af39`) — **tests only, SC only.** 5 `scripts/*.test.ts` (+623/−0). SC **487/487 → 542/542**, tsc clean, CI `regression` SUCCESS (`30038216829`), Vercel skipped (scripts-only). 3 existing wrapped routes still pass (regression-guarded) + a 3-wrapped tripwire. Both flag states exercised (env toggled only in a test-local `finally`-restored helper). Findings: SC sessions carry no `tenantId` → `withTenantRoute` fail-closes for unauthenticated families → token/webhook/cron need resource/explicit resolution; SC host map excludes the SC host; only `app/api/upload` scopes blob paths; `PROOF_PATH_RE` not prefix-aware. **UPD-1017–1023 BLOCKED pending this test-gate; UPD-1002 (UPD-1014/1015) and IMG-002 (UPD-1010–1013) PLANNED, not started (IMG-002 data-blocked).** No route wrapping, no flag/env/Production write, no registration, no dispatch, no merge; archived UPD-1004 untouched; SC `main` still `61a6d65`. |
