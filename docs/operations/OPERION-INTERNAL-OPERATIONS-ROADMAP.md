# Operion Internal Operations Completion Roadmap

**Updated:** 2026-07-21  
**Customers:** J KISS LLC and Supercharged  
**Scope:** Daily internal operations. Enterprise tenancy, editions, subscriptions, and self-service onboarding remain deferred.

This roadmap supersedes the execution ordering in `OPERION-V1-COMPLETION-REPORT.md`. That report remains the detailed repository audit; this document reflects the completed booking-assignment work and the verified Preview storage repair.

## Current baseline

- Booking-to-crew and equipment assignment is implemented behind `BOOKING_ASSIGNMENT_ENABLED`.
- Bookings and routes share schedule conflict detection.
- Assigned crew can see booking jobs, accept or decline, clock in/out, and attach completion photos.
- J KISS Preview uses `OperionPreview` Redis and `operion-preview-blob`.
- Supercharged Preview now uses its own `SuperchargedPreview` Redis; it is no longer connected to J KISS's Redis or Blob store.
- A dedicated `supercharged-preview-blob` exists and is connected to Supercharged Preview under `SC_PREVIEW_` variables. Existing Supercharged upload code still uses its legacy Blob token until the parity sprint migrates it.
- Preview crew uploads use presigned, put-only Blob tokens bound to the configured store ID.
- J KISS Production configuration and deployment were not changed during Sprint 0.
- Full suite: **1742/1742 passing**. AI regression: **2/2 passing**. TypeScript, focused lint, and production-mode build pass.

## Sprint 0 — Foundation cleanup

**Objective:** Put the booking-assignment branch on the current platform baseline and prove Preview/Production isolation before more feature work.

**Status:** Complete.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/lib/platform/flags.ts`
- `app/api/portal/upload/route.ts`
- `app/portal/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`
- `scripts/portal-presigned-upload.test.ts`
- Vercel Preview-only connections and variables for J KISS

**Completed work:**

- Merged current `origin/main` into `feat/booking-job-assignment` while preserving both booking and AI flags.
- Reconnected `OperionPreview` to J KISS for Preview only; replaced empty Redis credentials.
- Repaired Preview-only booking flag, admin password, and session secret.
- Replaced Supercharged's shared Preview Redis binding with `SuperchargedPreview` and removed its connection to J KISS's Preview Blob store.
- Provisioned dedicated Supercharged Preview Blob storage without replacing its existing upload token prematurely.
- Replaced legacy crew Blob upload transport with OIDC-compatible presigned uploads.
- Added a fail-closed store boundary: missing store configuration or a token for the wrong store rejects the upload.
- Verified a real protected-Preview upload on booking `JK-B-1009`; the persisted URL uses the `operion-preview-blob` hostname.

**Verification:** TypeScript; focused lint; 1742 tests; 2 AI regressions; production-mode build; mobile audit 45/45; authenticated protected-Preview crew upload; Redis read-back; Blob hostname/store-ID check.

**Difficulty:** High — configuration and storage isolation were the risk, not the UI change.

## Sprint 1 — Complete booking and crew workflow

**Objective:** Close the remaining operational seams after assignment, so a booking follows one explicit state path from dispatch through completion and pay preparation.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/lib/booking-assignment.ts`
- `app/lib/bookings.ts`
- `app/lib/crew-timeclock.ts`
- `app/lib/pay-statements.ts`
- `app/api/admin/bookings/[id]/assignment/route.ts`
- `app/api/portal/jobs/*`
- `app/admin/operations/book-now/[token]/page.tsx`
- `app/portal/jobs/*`

**Dependencies:** Sprint 0; existing staff, equipment, schedule, and finance records.

**Work remaining:** add a documented booking status-transition matrix; connect booking crew pay snapshots to pay-statement generation; rerun the complete assignment/accept/clock/photo/complete workflow with fresh non-test-like Preview fixtures; preserve legacy booking reads.

**Verification:** assignment and conflict tests; authorization tests; duplicate-action idempotency; real mobile crew flow; mixed route/booking pay statement fixture; Preview data inspection.

**Difficulty:** Medium.

## Sprint 2 — Finish admin operations dashboard

**Objective:** Give dispatch one simple daily view for bookings, routes, crew, equipment, conflicts, and work requiring attention.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/admin/operations/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/operations/schedule/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/operations/book-now/*`
- `app/components/admin/OperationsShell.tsx`
- `app/lib/schedule/*`
- admin schedule, booking, staff, and equipment APIs

**Dependencies:** Sprint 1 lifecycle and assignment source of truth.

**Verification:** desktop and 320/375/390/430 px layouts; search/filter state; one-click navigation from alerts to records; no hidden conflicts; role checks for owner/admin/manager; empty/loading/error states.

**Difficulty:** Medium-high.

## Sprint 3 — Finish crew mobile workflow

**Objective:** Make the crew portal dependable in a truck or at a job site, including weak-network behavior.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/portal/*`
- `app/api/portal/*`
- `app/lib/crew-timeclock.ts`
- completion-photo and document upload paths
- client-side pending-action storage/queue

**Dependencies:** Sprint 1 state matrix and Sprint 0 isolated upload transport.

**Verification:** iPhone and Android widths; accept/decline; clock in/out; retry after network interruption; duplicate taps; photo retry; assigned-only authorization; no pricing/internal-note leakage.

**Difficulty:** High — offline and retry behavior affects field reliability.

## Sprint 4 — Complete customer booking and AI quote experience

**Objective:** Make the existing customer pipeline understandable and dependable from photo selection through quote decision and OpsPilot visibility.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/quote/*`
- `app/api/quote/*`
- `app/lib/estimation/*`
- `app/lib/pricing/*`
- `app/lib/book-now-ai.ts`
- booking detail AI estimate panels and analytics events

**Dependencies:** Stable booking lifecycle from Sprint 1; no pricing-rule changes without explicit approval.

**Verification:** zero/one/six photos; remove/change photos invalidates stale analysis; provider failure saves manual-review booking; quote/range/manual-review outcomes; mobile photo previews; duplicate submission; OpsPilot read-back.

**Difficulty:** High.

## Sprint 5 — Payments, invoices, and customer history

**Objective:** Join booking execution, payment, invoice, communication, and customer history into one traceable record.

**Affected files/components:**

- `app/lib/pay-statements.ts`
- invoice and payment libraries/APIs
- `app/lib/customers.ts`
- booking/customer admin pages
- communications history and claims linkage

**Dependencies:** Sprints 1 and 4.

**Verification:** no duplicate customers/invoices/jobs; immutable issued statements; partial/full/manual payment; refunds; mixed booking/route pay; customer timeline; authorization and audit history.

**Difficulty:** High.

## Sprint 6 — AI latency optimization

**Objective:** Reduce the approximately 30-second photo-estimate latency without changing schema, deterministic pricing, confidence, or manual-review behavior.

**Affected files/components:**

- AI provider/model routing
- prompt registry and A/B configuration
- estimation telemetry and comparison reports
- Preview-only flags for LAT-002

**Dependencies:** Sprint 4 correctness baseline and representative photo fixtures.

**Verification:** isolated A/B test comparing latency, output tokens, model cost, quote parity, confidence parity, review rate, and schema validation; controlled provider integration run only when credentials are available.

**Difficulty:** Medium-high.

## Sprint 7 — Production readiness and Supercharged parity

**Objective:** Prove daily operation for both businesses, then release only the business-appropriate surfaces.

**Affected files/components:**

- release runbooks and gates
- Product Sync manifests and managed-target boundary enforcement
- J KISS and Supercharged Preview/Production configuration
- monitoring, rate limits, backups, and rollback evidence

**Dependencies:** Sprints 1–6; dedicated Supercharged Preview Redis and Blob isolation; control-plane files excluded from managed-target transfers.

**Verification:** full typecheck/lint/tests/build/AI regression; security and role matrix; real Preview workflow for both businesses; deployment/rollback canary; production smoke tests; one-week operational gap log.

**Difficulty:** High.

## Immediate next action

Complete Sprint 1 by defining and testing the booking status-transition matrix, then connect booking assignment pay snapshots to the existing pay-statement system. In parallel, replace Supercharged's shared `OperionPreview` Redis binding with its own Preview-only resource before syncing any additional Operion modules.
